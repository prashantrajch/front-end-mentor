## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla HTML & CSS
- Custom web fonts (Figtree)

### What I learned

This challenge helped me practice creating a fully responsive and visually polished card UI component using basic HTML and CSS. I focused on using custom fonts via `@font-face`, managing layout with Flexbox, and applying reusable design tokens via CSS variables.

Here's a code snippet showing how I implemented custom fonts:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Figtree Variable";
  src: url("./assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf") format("truetype");
  font-weight: 100 900;
  font-style: normal;
}
```
Continued development
In the future, I plan to:

Add hover interactions to the card title

Animate the card entrance using CSS transitions or keyframes

Explore converting this into a reusable component using a framework like React
