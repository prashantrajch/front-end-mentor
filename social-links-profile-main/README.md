## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla HTML & CSS

### What I learned

This project reinforced my understanding of:

- Centering elements using Flexbox.
- Creating clean and responsive card components.
- Styling buttons with hover effects using custom properties.

Example of the button hover effect:

```css
.social-list .social-link:hover,
.social-list .social-link:active {
  background-color: var(--color-green);
  color: black;
}
```

Continued development
In future projects, I’d like to:

Explore using a CSS preprocessor like SCSS for larger styling needs.

Add animations or transitions for more interactive UI elements.

Practice building more complex layouts with CSS Grid.

Useful resources
Frontend Mentor Documentation - Great for understanding expectations and best practices.

MDN Web Docs - My go-to reference for HTML and CSS syntax.

CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide - Helped me quickly set up the layout.
