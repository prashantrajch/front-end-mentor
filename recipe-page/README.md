## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Vanilla HTML/CSS (no frameworks)

### What I learned

This project helped me reinforce key frontend skills:

- **Structuring semantic content** for better accessibility and SEO.
- **Using CSS variables** for theme consistency and maintainability.
- **Designing mobile-first** layouts and adapting them with media queries.
- Implementing **clean visual hierarchy** using spacing, color, and typography.

```html
<section class="instructions-section">
  <h3 class="instructions-title">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="instructions-list">
    <li><strong>Beat the eggs:</strong> <span>In a bowl, ...</span></li>
  </ol>
</section>
css
Copy
Edit
:root {
  --color-Stone-100: hsl(30, 54%, 90%);
  --color-Rose-800: hsl(332, 51%, 32%);
}
```

Continued development
In future projects, I aim to explore:

Using CSS Grid more effectively for complex layouts.

Improving accessibility (a11y) by adding ARIA roles and keyboard navigation.

Incorporating animations and transitions for enhanced user experience.

Useful resources
CSS Variables (MDN) â€“ Helped me understand scoped variables.

Flexbox Guide (CSS Tricks) â€“ A go-to resource for layout structuring.
