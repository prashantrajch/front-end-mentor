## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Fraunces, Montserrat)

### What I learned

This project helped me improve my skills in responsive design and layout composition using **Flexbox**. I also got more familiar with using **CSS custom properties (variables)** for color and spacing consistency.

I practiced using `background-image` in CSS for responsive layouts, and I improved my understanding of how to structure components semantically.

```html
<!-- HTML structure for product info -->
<section class="product-info">
  <header class="product-header">
    <span class="product-category">Perfume</span>
    <h1 class="product-title">Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum</h1>
  </header>
  ...
</section>

/* CSS for responsive layout */
@media screen and (max-width: 375px) {
  .card {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
  .product-image {
    background-image: url("./images/image-product-mobile.jpg");
  }
}
```

Continued development
In future projects, I would like to:

Explore using CSS Grid for similar layouts.

Add JavaScript interactivity, such as updating a cart count.

Improve accessibility (focus states, alt attributes, ARIA roles).

Practice converting this static card into a React component.

### ✅ Next Steps

- Replace the `screenshot.jpg` file with your actual screenshot.
- Update the `Solution URL` and `Live Site URL`.
- If you didn’t use React, Next.js, or Styled Components (as in the original template), I removed them from the list — your project is purely HTML + CSS.

Would you like me to also help you:
- Deploy this on GitHub Pages or Vercel?
- Add the screenshot for you if you upload it?
