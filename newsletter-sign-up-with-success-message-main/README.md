## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox  
- Mobile-first workflow  
- Responsive images using `<picture>`  
- Vanilla JavaScript (form validation and UI state handling)

### What I learned

This project helped me practice handling multiple UI states such as form validation errors and success messages using JavaScript. I learned how to validate user input using regular expressions and how to show clear visual feedback when the input is invalid.

I also improved my understanding of responsive layouts by using media queries and the `<picture>` element to serve different images based on screen size.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on:

- Improving accessibility using ARIA attributes  
- Better keyboard navigation support  
- Refactoring JavaScript into more modular and reusable functions  
- Adding smooth animations for UI transitions
